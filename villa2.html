          A resort (North American English) is a self-contained commercial
          establishment that tries to provide most of a vacationer's wants, such
          as food, drink, lodging, sports, entertainment, and shopping, on the
          premises. The term resort may be used for a hotel property that
          provides an array of amenities, typically including entertainment and
          recreational activities. A hotel is frequently a central feature of a
          resort, such as the Grand Hotel at Mackinac Island, Michigan. Some
          resorts are also condominium complexes that are timeshares or owed
          fractionally or wholly owned condominium. A resort is not always a
          commercial establishment operated by a single company, but in the late
          20th century, that sort of facility became more common. In British
          English, "resort" means a town which people visit for holidays and
          days out which usually contains hotels at which such holidaymakers
          stay. Examples would include Blackpool and Brighton.
